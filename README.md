# ZombieRunner
## ZombieRunner 3D Game from the Final Part of the 3D Game Development with Unity from GameDevTV.
In the final section of the C# Unity Game Developer 3D Course I improved my already acquired knowledge from the previous sections by creating 
a FPS game where the main objective for the player is to survive against the enemies. 
Apart from that I gained experience building prefabs and creating structures by using Unity's Probuilder Package and dynamic AI Pathfinding by using the NavmeshSystem.
The game was further polished by adding different animations and lighting effects to further enhance the player's experience.
